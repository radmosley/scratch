    <p>
      Narwhals normally congregate in groups of about five to ten and sometimes
      up to 20 individuals outside the summer. Groups may be "nurseries" with
      only females and young, or can contain only post-dispersal juveniles or
      adult males ("bulls"), but mixed groups can occur at any time of year.
